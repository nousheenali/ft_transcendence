        In this game, a tiny ball bounces around the screen, rebounding off the
        top and bottom edges.
      </p>
      <p>
        Two players control their pads, sliding them vertically to catch the
        ball.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the ball touches a pad, it bounces back to the other player. If a
        player misses the ball, the opponent scores a point.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ball&apos;s bounce direction changes based on how it hits the pad.
        Enjoy the exciting gameplay!
